### Outline of Pokéllector

Like DINOTYCOON and ZOO TYCOON but with Pokémon



### Goal of the game: ###

To have a managerie of Pokémon with individual unique personalities and optimal cage conditions

Happiness scores can be computed per Pokémon and for the managerie 


### Class objects in the game: ###

PLAYER has a MANAGERIE which has CAGES which can hold POKEMON which have unique PERSONALITIES

PERSONALITIES are a series of RESPONSES to STIMULI

PLAYER does not have direct access to the POKEMON's PERSONALITY but can learn their indiviudal RESPONSES to STIMULI through gameplay

STIMULI can be ITEMS, HABITAT, SPACE, ROOMMATES, SHELTER, and INTERACTION

STIMULI can have different PROPERTIES that the POKEMON may or may not respond to, but such response will be consistant for that POKEMON

	
	### EXAMPLE: ###

	SQUIRTLE-A134 (a POKEMON) may like the blue ball in the cage because it is blue, while SQUIRTLE-A137 may like the blue ball because it bounces

	SQUIRTLE-A134 may not like a red ball, but SQUIRTLE-A137 may like it just as much

	Such RESPONSES to a STIMULUS like a ball are player-discoverable downstream results of the a RESPONSE to the STIMULUS's PROPERTIES

	These PROPERTIES can be booleans or scalers, and the PERSONALITY's optimal PROPERTY does not need to be at an extreme of the scaler

	For instance, SQUIRTLE-A137 may like the blue ball with a bounciness of .6 just as much as the red ball with a bounciness of .8, but its optimal bounciness is .7
